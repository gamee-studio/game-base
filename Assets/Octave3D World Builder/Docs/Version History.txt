[Bug Fix]	: fixed bug which was caused by scripting API changes in Unity 2018.2;

V 2.2.3.1
[New Feature]: it is now possible to select a layer in which objects get spawned;
[New Feature]: it is now possible to replace the game object associated with an object group;

[Improvement]: it is now possible to toggle decor paint axis alignment via SHIFT + W;
[Improvement]: removed huge delay when switching to play mode and back;
[Improvement]: added SHIFT + R hotkey which allows to pick prefabs from the scene while also
			   inheriting the world scale of the picked object. NOTE: This may cause unexpected
			   results when clicking on children of other objects in which case, the scale of
			   the picked child will be used to adjust the scale of the root. Therefore, this
			   functionality works best when dealing with single objects or hierarchies in which
			   the children have a scale of 1. You can also aleviate this problem by makign sure 
			   you click on the parent of the hierarchy.

// V 2.2.3
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to project a Block onto mesh and terrain objects;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to  perform vertex snapping in selection mode just as you can do
			  in placement mode;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to snap the grid using the T key in object selection mode;
-NEW FEATURE: select active object group;

-IMPROVEMENT: object 2 object snapping is now faster when snapping hierarchies;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to specify the maximum size of a Block;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to assign selected objects to object groups;
-IMPROVEMENT: the placement guide will now initially start off with the rotation of the prefab
			  from which it was spawned. This happens only the first time a prefab is activated;
-IMPROVEMENT: implemented "Remove" button to remove an object group without destroying
			  the associated game object from the scene;
-IMPROVEMENT: improved object picking for overlapped thin objects (floors and ceilings for example);

-CHANGE: turning gizmos on/off is now done using the Toggle Gizmos check box;
-CHANGE: the extrude gizmo is now activated using the Q key;
-CHANGE: replace selection with prefab on preview click is now done with SHIFT instead of SPACE;

-BUG FIX: object to object snapping was ignoring the object snap mask. This has now been fixed;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was blocking prefab replacement to occur when using prefab previews. This
		  requierd a hotkey change from SPACE + click on preview to SHIFT + click on preview;
-BUG FIX: fixed null reff exception which was thrown when interacting with mesh objects that
          didn't have a renderer component attached to them;
-BUG FIX: fixed prefab replace operation was not taking object groups into account;

// V 2.2.2.1
-NEW FEATURE: added 'Use original pivot' toggle for the Single Decor Paint placement mode;

-BUG FIX: fixed lag after loading prefab configs for scenes with large number of objects;
-BUG FIX: fixed rotation randomization for block placement mode not rotating around center;

// V 2.2.2
-NEW FEATURE: implemented object selection extrude gizmo which allows you to extrude selected objects by 
			  draging the gizmo axes handles;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to perform selection object to object snap (toggle with U);
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to rotate selected objects via the X, Y an Z keys. The rotation step
			  can be modified from the object selection Inspector for each individual axis;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to rotate and scale objects during a selection grab session;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to set the rotation of selected objects to identity (zero rotation).
			  This is done by pressing the I key on the keyboard;

-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to specify an object group for objects that are created via selection
			  operation (e.g. gizmo drag duplicate, CTRL + D duplicate, mirroring);
-IMPROVEMENT: object 2 object snapping can now be toggled on/off via the U hotkey;
-IMPROVEMENT: added info labels inside the scene view for 2 snap related states;
-IMPROVEMENT: improved object to object snapping. This snap mode can now handle modular pieces of
			  different sizes a lot better than before by using mesh data for better volume/box approximation;
-IMPROVEMENT: when starting a selection grab session the object(s) no longer do an instant snap when 
		      the mouse is moved for the first time;

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing selected objects to be mirrored more than once when part of a multi-level hierarchy;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing object groups to be mirrored together with their children;
-BUG FIX: fixed floating static meshes due to invisible geometry;
-BUG FIX: fixed null ref exception when generating prefab previews after lights were deleted from the scene;
-BUG FIX: fixed duplicated (CTRL + D) objects could not be interacted with;
-BUG FIX: fixed prefab previews too bright on script recompile;
-BUG FIX: fixed selection replace no working if clicked objects is not prefab instance;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing weird behaviour for Path Placement mode with 'Rotate objects to folow path' option checked;
-BUG FIX: fixed prefab previews not taking prefab scale into account;

// V 2.2.1.3
-BUG FIX: fixed floating skinned meshes;
-BUG FIX: fixed prefab preview too small;

// V 2.2.1.2
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to tell the tool that an object is no longer a group by right-clicking on the object inside the hierarchy 
			  and then clicking on the 'Octave3D->Is not group' menu item;

-IMPROVEMENT: when picking prefabs in the scene, a prefab is automatically created and added to the active category if
			  this prefab doesn't already exist. Previously, nothing happened if the prefab didn't exist inside a category;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to specify an offset from surface for decor paint brush elements;
-IMPROVEMENT: when saving a prefab config, the prefab scroll view look and feel settings are also saved;
-IMPROVEMENT: added dialogs to display useful info when performing mesh combine operations;
-IMPROVEMENT: added option to disable the parent of the source mesh objects after performing mesh combine operations;
-IMPROVEMENT: performance improvement. The Unity Editor used to lag while moving the camera, spawning objects, selecting objects etc. 
			  This was caused by Octave3D trying to serialize a binary tree data structure which contained information
			  about all the objects in the scene. For larger scenes (e.g. 20K+), this was slowing down the Editor;
-IMPROVEMENT: prefab preview generation could cause lags when loading multiple prefabs at once (e.g. from folders) into a
			  prefab category. This has now been fixed. Note: Preview may look different than before because now a custom
			  preview generation function is used instead of the one supplied by the Unity API;
-IMPROVEMENT: when spawning objects, the tool will ignore surfaces derived from objects with a disabled mesh renderer. This
			  is necessary to handle situations in which invisible objects have been placed in the scene by the artist to act
			  as collision surfaces;

-REMOVED: 'Embed in surface' toggle for decor paint brush elements;

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing the tool to interact with inactive objects;

// V 2.2.1.1
-BUG FIX: fixed exceptions being thrown when entering play mode;
-BUG FIX: fixed 'SnapToCursorHitPoint' not saved correctly in Octave3D config file;
-BUG FIX: fixed prefab tag associations not loaded properly from prefab config file;
-BUG FIX: fixed prefab tag associations lost during script recompile (serialization issue);

// V 2.2.1
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to add objects to an erase mask to prevent certain objects in the scene from being
			  erased. This is done from the object selection GUI (last 2 eraser buttons);

-IMPROVEMENT: category remove and clear operations are now done via a context menu (right click on prefab management
			  window to activate);
-IMPROVEMENT: the 'Create category' button was moved somehwere towards the top of the prefab management window (near the
			  'Prefab drop settings... button);
-IMPROVEMENT: the 'Move ### prefab(s)' buttons from the prefab management window were removed and replaced with a single
			  button and 2 popup controls which allow you to perform the same operations as before;
-IMPROVEMENT: when using CTRL + D to duplicate selected objects, the duplicate objects maintain their links to the prefab
			  from which the original objects were created;
-IMPROVEMENT: the 'Miss chance' property for brush elements has been modified to 'Spawn chance' and the generation algorithm
			  has been improved to better pick the most probable element based on the specified spawn chance;
-IMPROVEMENT: renamed 'Set as Object Group' menu item to 'Make group';

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was ignoring the scene grid X and Z offsets to be saved in the Octave3D config file;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was preventing Undo/Redo to work after clearing all categories;
-BUG FIX: fixed null ref excpetion being thrown when performing an Undo for prefab category remove ops when those categories 
		  had prefabs stored inside the active brush. Possibly introduced in the previous update;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing the first object inside a brush to be generated in the center of the brush instead of
		  being placed in a random position.

// V 2.2
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to specify a pivot point for the combined meshes;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to specify a parent object when combining meshes. The tool will combine all the
			  child objects attached to that parent;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to combine selected objects;
-NEW FEATURE: context menu item is now available when right clicking an object in the hierarchy view. This item is
			  called Octave3D->Set as Object Group and it allows you to create object groups from objects that already
			  exist in the scene;

-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to perform prefab replacement for selected objects by clicking on prefabs in the
			  active category (see hotkeys document);
-IMPROVEMENT: better customization regarding colliders when combining meshes;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to choose whether lightmapping UVs must be generated for combined meshes;
-IMPROVEMENT: the tool no longer forces you to attach objects as children to the Octave3D object. All objects in
			  the scene can now be interacted with. Note: When creating objects manually, you still need to press
			  the 'Refresh scene' button to be able to interact with those objects;
-IMPROVEMENT: the look and feel settings for the prefab category scroll view area now reside in a separate window. This
			  window can be activated using the "Look and feel..." button;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to modify the color of the prefab name labels inside the prefab category view;

-BUG FIX: there is new window available in Tools->Octave3D->Fix... which allows you to fix a bug that was causing stray
	      objects to be left behind after Resetting the Octave3D script component. These were objects used internally
		  by Octave3D to store different types of data. Pressing the Fix button in this window will cleanup the scene
		  of any such stray objects. This fix also needs to be performed when upgrading from an earlier version to 2.2
		  or above;
-BUG FIX: fixed scene grid rendering bug introduced in V 2.1 when grid shader rendering support was introduced. This bug
		  was preventing the grid from rendering correctly for different rotation values.

// V 2.1
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to project selected objects on a projection surface (such as terrain or mesh);
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to snap selected objects to the grid. This works in a similar manner to vertex
			  snapping in object placement mode. The hotkey is 'B' when working in selection mode;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to load all the prefabs from the active category inside the active decor paint brush;
-NEW FEATURE: a new feature is now available called Selection Grab. With it, you can 'grab' the selected objects and
			  snap them to terrain or mesh surfaces. Axis alignment can be toggled on/off as needed. The hotkey for this
			  is the 'C' key when working in selection mode;
-NEW FEATURE: Embed in surface toggle for Single Decor Paint mode which ensures objects are nicely embedded inside the
			  surface when no axis alignment is performed. This eliminates the floating object problem;
-NEW FEATURE: Embed in surface toggle for Brush Decor Paint mode which ensures objects are nicely embedded inside the
			  surface when no axis alignment is performed. This eliminates the floating object problem;

-IMPROVEMENT: the scene XZ grid is now rendered using a shader and uses anti-aliasing for smooth line rendering;
-IMPROVEMENT: the 'Hide wireframe' button below the main toolbar has been changed to 'Toggle wireframe' so that
			  the wireframe/highlight of objects in the scene can be toggled on/off as needed;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to right click on a prefab in the active category and add it to the active brush.
			  This only works when working in Decor Paint Brush mode and there is an active brush available;
-IMPROVEMENT: all brush elements are now rendered nicely inside a scroll view area (much like the prefab manager)
			  and you can now choose (left click) a prefab inside the brush to modify its properties. This frees up
			  a lot of space and is a lot easier to use than the previous arrangement in which all elements had their
			  properties displayed at the same time and you had to scroll up/down until you found what you were looking
			  for.
	
-REMOVED: removed 'Align all to stroke' and 'Unalign all to stroke' buttons inside the active brush view to free up
	      space;

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing Octave3D to eat a HUGE amount of CPU power when switching to playmode; 

// V 2.0.9.7
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to have multiple Octave3D instances in the same scene;
-IMPROVEMENT: rotation randomization for paint brush elements has been made more flexible. Instead of a toggle
			  button, a popup is now used which allows you to specify if and how rotation should be randomized.

-BUG FIX: fixed null reference exception error which was thrown when switching scenes.

// V 2.0.9.6
-IMPROVEMENT: when dropping prefab folders there is now an additional progress bar which shows the progress
			  of loading the prefab assets;
-IMPROVEMENT: a progress bar is now shown when clicking on the 'Remove all categories' button inside the prefab
			  management window.

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was preventing the object group selection popup from being rendered for the
	      active prefab category. This was happening when an object groups was manually deleted from
		  the hierarchy view instead of using the Octave3D interface.

// V 2.0.9.5
-IMPROVEMENT: added confirmation message dialogs which appear after a prefab or any other config type is
		      saved/loaded successfully.

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was creating duplicate object groups when loading prefab configurations after 
		  switching to a different scene. This bug should have been fixed in 2.0.9.2, but that solution
		  only worked as long as no new scenes were being created.

// V 2.0.9.4
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to press F to focus the camera on the selected objects. Note: when doing
			  this, you will see hot the selection in the hierarchy changes temporarily until the focus
			  effect is finished. This was necessary to be able to focus the camera correctly.

-BUG FIX: sometimes, when loading a prefab config, incorrect prefabs were being loaded in the
		  categories. This was happening especially when switching to a new scene or after saving
		  the current scene. This has now been fixed;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was ignoring any prefab folder names associated with a prefab category
		  when saving/loading a prefab config.

// V 2.0.9.3
-NEW FEATURE: implemented selection alignment along X/Y/Z. The alignment buttons can be found
			  inside the object selection GUI.

// V 2.0.9.2
-IMPROVEMENT: prefab categories are now sorted alphabetically;
-IMPROVEMENT: prefabs which are created from folder drops, can now have the folder names displayed
			  inside the category selection popup. You can use the 'Show folder names' toggle inside
			  the prefab management window to control this behaviour. From there, the maximum number
			  of shown folders can also be controlled;
-IMPROVEMENT: when object to object snapping is enabled, the tool will always snap to cursor hit point
			  and snap pivot points are ignored. This behaviour is desirable when object to object snapping
			  is turned on.

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was preventing the scene camera to orbit;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was preventing the tool from correctly selecting objects which were overlapped
		  by inactive objects;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was creating duplicate object groups when loading prefab configurations.

// V 2.0.9.1
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to control the snap grid's X and Z offsets inside the snap settings GUI;

-BUG FIX: fixed null ref exception when loading prefab configs after package reimport;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing a save file dialog to open when trying to load settings configs;

// V 2.0.9
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to save/load prefab configurations. A prefab configuration is composed of all prefab categories
			  (together with their prefabs) and all prefab tags. The 2 buttons can be found in the prefab management window;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to save/load snap, selection, erasing and look an feel settings selectively;

-IMPROVEMENT: for snapping, it is now possible to use the object's pivot (as was defined in the modelling package). This can
			  be done by checking the 'Use original pivot' toggle in the Snap Settings GUI. When this toggle is checked, the
			  'Snap center to center' toggles (both of them) will become hidden. Snapping cente to center is still possible
			  using the SPACE key;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to associate an object group with a prefab category. In the object placement GUI you have the 
			  option of specifying if objects must be attached to the active group or to the group associated with the currently
			  active prefab category;
-IMPROVEMENT: when creating prefabs from selected objects, it is now possible to select a predefined pivot point for the 
			  resulting prefab. Previously the root of the prefab hierarchy was placed at the origin which means that the
			  pivot of the entire hierarchy was way off. Specifying a pivot is now necessary since the addition of the 
			  'Use original pivot' toggle in the snap settings GUI;
-IMPROVEMENT: the name of the object placement guide has been changed to: name_of_prefab (Active Prefab) to make it more easy to see 
			  what the active preab is;
-IMPROVEMENT: the name of the active prefab is now shown in green in the top right corner of the scene view;
-IMPROVEMENT: the Octave3D grid is now aligned with the Unity grid by default. Note: The 2 grids can still become desynchronized
			  when chaning the grid cell size;
-IMPROVEMENT: there is a new button in the object placement settings GUI. It's label is "Inherit rotation on prefab scroll" and if
			  checked, it will allow you to inherit the rotation of the previously active prefab when cycling through different prefabs
			  in the active category which the mouse scroll wheel;

-FEATURE REMOVAL: removed static/dynamic flag for prefabs in the active prefab view. The reason for this is because it wasn't
				  very flexible since it was affecting the entire hierarchy. Most of the times it is most desirable for users
				  to walk though the entire prefab hierarchy and set the static and dynamic flags accordingly;
-FEATURE REMOVAL: removed object layer selection in the active prefab view. Same reason as above;
-FEATURE REMOVAL: removed rectangle draw mode for object selection;

-BUG FIX: fixed null ref exception when Undo prefab folder drop when 'Create categories from dropped folders' was unchecked;
-BUG FIX: the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons in the active prefab only worked in object placement mode. This has now been fixed
		  so the buttons work regardless of the currently active GUI;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing the double click same prefab selection to work incorrectly with object hierarchies. Only
		  one object in the hierarchy was being selected. This has now been fixed and all hierarchy objects get selected accordingly.
-BUG FIX: fixed mouse input block problem when 2 mouse buttons were pressed at the same time. This issue should have been fixed
		  in previous updates...

// V 2.0.8
-NEW FEATURE: the system can now handle 2D sprites which means that it is now possible to use the tool to build 2D game levels;
-NEW FEATURE: a new button is now available ("Refresh scene") right below the main toolbar which allows you to refresh the
			  internal scene data. One case in which this is useful is when changing sprite pivot points. In that case the
			  sprite positions will be modified without the tool knowing about it which means that you will no longer be able
			  to interact with those sprites properly. This button is also useful in case the scene data somehow becomes corrupt.

-IMPROVEMENT: when attempting to change the extension plane while using tile connections, the tool now shows a warning to inform
			  the user that the extension plane can not be changed as long as tile connections are used;
-IMPROVEMENT: when using the Path or Block placement modes, the tool no longer raises/lowers these structures when the size of
			  the object is 0 along the grow axis;
-IMPROVEMENT: there is a new button available when working with tile connection configurations which allows you to load
			  the active configuration. This is useful when you have only one configuration available and you would like to
			  restore the configuration after you made some changes (without saving the config). Previously, the only way to
			  do this was to Undo or create a dummy config, activate it and then activate the desired config again. The button
			  is labeled "Load active configuration";
-IMPROVEMENT: assigning/removing objects to/from paint/snap masks can no longer be undone/redone. The reason behind this is these
			  operations can not be immediately verified visually which can create confusion. Users may want to undo/redo other
			  types of operations but in doing so may accidentaly add or remove objects from masks which is not desirable;

-BUG FIX: fixed objects not erased on left mouse button click (this bug was introduced in the previous update);
-BUG FIX: when pressing 'K' to adjust the grid size, the orientation of the grid was not taken into account
		  properly and this could lead to wrong grid sizes being calculated;
-BUG FIX: fixed null ref exception when one of the 'Remove prefab association' buttons was pressed in conjunction with
		  tile connections;

// V 2.0.7
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to adjust the XZ grid Y position using shortcut keys. The step value can be adjusted
			  from the Snap Settings GUI;

-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to use negative values for the 'Distance between objects' property when using the Decor
			  Paint Brush placement mode. This is useful when you need to force objects to sit right next to each other
			  and it might come in handy when placing foliage as in that case it might look better if objects sit really
			  close or even intersect with each other;

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing the Octave3D mono object to become deselected when placing objects;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was throwing a null ref exception when working with meshes that contained degenerate triangles;

// V 2.0.6
-NEW FEATURE: implemented object to object snapping which allows the easy snapping of the object placement guide to nearby
			  objects based on a specified epsilon value. This mode can be activated from the snap settings GUI;
-NEW FEATURE: added new button in the Object Selection GUI which can be used to invert selection (i.e. deselect all object which 
			  are currently selected and select the other ones);
-NEW FEATURE: added a toggle button which when checked, it will allow you to snap the active pivot point to the intersection
			  point between the mouse cursor and the hovered surface. This toggle button resides in the snap settings GUI;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to change the rotation of the XZ grid. This can be useful when working with a 2D camera view;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to specify an offset from placement surface for each prefab (offset from grid and offset from object surfaces).
			  This is useful when working with a 2D camera view as it allows you to specify different offsets for background and
			  foreground objects;
-NEW FEATURE: implemented selection duplication functionality. The selection can be duplicated when working in object selection
			  mode by pressing CTRL + D. Note: This functionality does not preserve prefab links and it works only in Unity 5.0 or above;

-IMPROVEMENT: added a new snap center to center toggle so that now it is possible to snap center to center selectively depending
			  on the type of hovered snap surface (grid cell or object surface);
-IMPROVEMENT: when using tile connections, the path extension plane will always reside at the bottom of the object placement guide.
			  This is necessary to ensure that all tile connection prefabs have valid X and Z size components;

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing Unity to throw an exception when constructing a path or block when the object size was 0 
		  along one of the path's/block's extension axes;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing the size of the path/block stacks to be calculated incorrectly for arbitrary object placement
	      guide rotations;

// V 2.0.4
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to double-click on objects in conjunction with the T hotkey in order to snap the grid
			  to the top or bottom of the object depending on which one is closer to the mouse cursor click point.

// V 2.0.3
-NEW FEATURE: in selection mode, it is now possible to select all objects that share the same prefab by double clicking
			  on an object;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to randomize the prefabs in the active category for the Decor Paint (Single mode) and 
			  Point and Click placement modes;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to randomize the objects that get placed inside a path or block. The object prefabs are
			  chosen randomly from the active prefab category;

-BUG FIX: when selecting objects with similar prefabs using the 'G' key, the gizmo position is now updated properly;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing the Octave3D object to be deleted from the scene when the 'Delete' key was pressed;
-BUG FIX: when activating/deactivating mirrors, the result was not immediately visible in the scene view. This has
		  been fixed. As soon as a mirror is activated/deactivated, the scene view is repainted accordingly;
-BUG FIX: when modifying the rotation of a mirror via the Inspector GUI, the results were not immediately visible
		  in the scene view. This has now been fixed by repainting the scene view accordingly;
-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing the 'Allow intersection for mirrored objects' property to be ignored when dealing
		  with objects that contain negative scale;

// V 2.0.2
-IMPROVEMENT: when building a block with the 'Block' placement mode, the tool now shows the block dimensions in the top left
		      corner of the scene view;
-IMPROVEMENT: added toggle button for snap center to center. When this is checked, the tool will always snap the center pivot
			  point to the center of the snap surface. It has the same effect as when holding down the 'Space' key, the only
			  exception being that it is permanent as long as the toggle button is checked;
-IMPROVEMENT: folders can now be dropped onto the destination folder name field inside the prefab creation settings view;

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was preventing GUI textures from loading properly on OSX;

// V 2.0.1
-IMPROVEMENT: implemented toggle button which allows you to specify if objects can be painted on the grid. This applies to
			  both 'Single' and 'Brush' decor paint modes;
-IMPROVEMENT: changed the hotkey for placing a path with the 'Path' placement mode from SPACE to LSHIFT. This was necessary
			  because the SPACE key was conflicting with the snap center to center hotkey;

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing mouse and keyboard input to become blocked when more than 2 mouse buttons were pressed;
-BUG FIX: scene navigation is now possible using the arrow keys;

// V 2.0
-NEW FEATURE: implemented a new placement mode called 'Decor Paint'. This mode works in 2 ways: 'Single' and 'Brush' and it replaces
			  what was previosuly known as 'Precise snapping'. It is ideal for placing objects on a terrain or on the mesh surfaces of
			  other objects. The brush mode allows you to perform multi-prefab placement;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to specify if the objects which are placed in the scene should be attached as children of the hovered object;
-NEW FEATURE: prefab tags.  Users can now associate a prefab with a series of tags which can act as filters for the active prefab category.
			  Using tags the user can easily hide/show only the prefabs that they are interested in, making prefab searching much easier. Now,
			  when dragging a folder onto the active category, the user can specify if they wish to automatically create tags based on the 
			  folder names. Subfolders are also taken into account;
-NEW FEATURE: search prefabs by name;
-NEW FEATURE: the object placement guide can now be rotated using the mouse. The rotation can happen around the X, Y and Z axes or around 
			  the normal of the surface on which the object resides. Users can control the mouse sensitivity;
-NEW FEATURE: the object placement guide can now be uniform-scaled using the mouse. Users can control the mouse sensitivity;
-NEW FEATURE: the snapping system has been redesigned making it much more intuitive and easier to use;
-NEW FEATURE: 2 new erase tools -> 2D and 3D mass erase (useful for quickly erasing large collections of objects). The 3D erase brush is especially
			  useful when erasing objects which reside on a terrain;
-NEW FEATURE: rotation and scale randomization settings for the placement guide when working in Decor Paint or Point and Click placement modes;
-NEW FEATURE: placement guide surface alignment for all placement modes;
-NEW FEATURE: it is now possible to specify an 'Autofill' tile when using tile connections. This can be used to fill up closed areas inside a path
			  when using the 'Path' placement mode with tile connections turned on;
-NEW FEATURE: each tile connection now has an associated Y offset;
-NEW FEATURE: each tile connection can now be extruded upwards and/or downwards. The extrusion amount can be specified in the Inspector;
-NEW FEATURE: when using the 'Block' placement mode, the block can now be adjusted using a 1:1 ratio;
-NEW FEATURE: implemented 'Automatic Random' height adjustment mode for the 'Block' placement mode;
-NEW FEATURE: implemented subdivision settings for the 'Block' placement mode (allows you to subdivide a block into smaller blocks);
-NEW FEATURE: implemented decor paint masks in addition to snap masks;
-NEW FEATURE: shortcut key for selecting all objects which share the same prefab;
-NEW FEATURE: snapping when scaling or rotating the guide using the mouse;
-NEW FEATURE: object groups for better scene management;
-NEW FEATURE: the placement guide can now be offset from the placement surface using a collection of hotkeys and mouse movement;
-NEW FEATURE: the user can now replace prefabs in the scene using the object selection mechanism;
-NEW FEATURE: vertex position welding when combining meshes with similar materials
-NEW FEATURE: when operating in placement mode, it is now possible to snap object vertices to other object vertices or to grid cell points almost similar to 
			  the way in which vertex snapping works with the Unity Editor move gizmo;
-NEW FEATURE: ability to activate a prefab by picking it from the scene;

-IMPROVEMENT: much more easier to interact with mirrors. They can now be manipulated using the mouse and the keyboard;
-IMPROVEMENT: floating windows are used for managing prefabs, prefab tags and object layers. These windows can be nested as needed;
-IMPROVEMENT: ability to select/deselect the tool object using the ALT + R/D shortuct keys;
-IMPROVEMENT: shortcut key for snapping the center pivot point of an object to the center of the snap surface;
-IMPROVEMENT: in the previou version, when an object was hovered with the cursor, the tool activated a snap grid along the hovered object volume face.
			  This is still available in this version, but the grid now takes the rotation of the object into account;
-IMPROVEMENT: now, when erasing objects, by default the entire object hierarchy is erased. It is possible to use hotkeys to switch to another mode in 
			  which only the objects which were hovered by the cursor or which lie inside the erase brush get erased;
-IMPROVEMENT: implemented 'Allow Partial Overlap' toggle for object erasing and object selection. If not checked, objects will be erased/selected only 
			  if they lie completely inside the selection/erase shape;
-IMPROVEMENT: when working in 'Path' placement mode, the path can now be constructed along any direction (in the previous version only the global X, Y 
			  and Z axes were used);
-IMPROVEMENT: when working in 'Block' placement mode, the block can now be constructed along any direction (in the previous version only the global X, Y 
			  and Z axes were used);
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to use negative padding values for the 'Path' placement mode;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to use negative padding values for the 'Block' placement mode;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to control a path's offset along its grow direction when working in 'Path' placement mode;
-IMPROVEMENT: it is now possible to control a block's offset along its grow direction when working in 'Block' placement mode;
-IMPROVEMENT: 2 selection update modes are now available: 'SingleObject' and 'EntireHierarchy'. When 'SingleObject' is active, only the object which is 
			  clicked or falls within the area of the selection shape gets selected/deselected. When 'EntireHierarchy' is active, the entire hierarchy 
			  to which the object belongs gets selected/deselected;

-FEATURE REMOVAL: object layers. The tool now uses Unity layers for layer management;
-FEATURE REMOVAL: prefab category filters;
-FEATURE REMOVAL: object selection view (together with selection filters);
-FEATURE REMOVAL: snap configurations - no longer needed with the new snapping system in place;
-FEATURE REMOVAL: dynamic mirroring - not very useful and sometimes confusing;
-FEATURE REMOVAL: ability to place triggers using the 'ogTrigger' script;
-FEATURE REMOVAL: tile connection pose rotation - confusing and not useful. Virtually 100% of the time it is desirable to use the prefab's pose;

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which was causing GUI textures to become dark when the color space was set to 'Linear' in the project settings;

// V 1.1
-NEW FEATURE: added possibility to place objects on a terrain using precise snapping. The terrain does not necessarily have to 
			  be child of the grid object;
-NEW FEATURE: the tool now maintains the link between the objects places in the scene and the prefabs from which they were
			  instantiated;
-NEW FEATURE: added 'Prepare for level edit', 'Prepare for play test' and 'Prepare for final build' buttons which allow you to 
			  ensure that the scene is always up to date with all the data/information required for level editing or play/final build.
			  Please see doc chapter 3.1;

-IMPROVEMENT: automatic snapping improved by making cell size smaller and the number of cell size now depends on the size of the 
			  snap surface.
-IMPROVEMENT: it is no longer needed to manually change the user interaction mode. It changes automatically when the active GUI
			  is changed;
-IMPROVEMENT: you can now choose the collider type for ogTrigger objects. Please see doc chapter 3.1;
-IMPROVEMENT: the tool no longer attaches colliders to game objects. The game objects are no longer touched in any way by the tool;
-IMPROVEMENT: the GUI icon paths have been made relative to the ObjectGrid3D folder. The ObjectGrid3D folder can now be moved anywhere
			  as long as you make sure that no other ObjectGrid3D folder exists in the project;
-IMPROVEMENT: object names are now set to the name of the prefab from which they are instantiated;
-IMPROVEMENT: the name of the object placement guide has also been ammended to ObjectPlacementGuide (NameofPrefab);
-IMPROVEMENT: when pressing the 'Get All Prefabs In Project' button, the tool will now ask for a confirmation before continuing. This
			  is more desirable in order to avoid accidental clicks of this button which can cause a stall in Unity when too many
			  prefabs are present in the project.

-FEATURE REMOVAL: removed Remove###Collider toggles from the Optimization GUI because they are no longer needed. The tool does not
			      add any colliders to the game objects any more;
-FEATURE REMOVAL: removed Box Collider Size For Non-Mesh Objects property; the collider size is now configurable for light, particle 
				  system and trigger components using the settings which sit right underneath the main toolbar (please see doc chapter 3.1);
-FEATURE REMOVAL: it is no longer possible to snap long the collider surfaces of light and particle system objects. This feature was
				  removed because it is not really useful. It can actually get in the way.

-BUG FIX: the scene view is now repainted when mirrors are activated or deativated so changes can now be seen instantly;
-BUG FIX: scene navigation using the WASD and QE keys is now fixed;
-BUG FIX: the project could not be built because a file 'ogBlockRotationRandomizationSettings.cs' file did not have the 
		  #if UNITY_EDITOR and #endif directives included. This has now been fixed;
-BUG FIX: for plane surfaces, objects were sometimes snapped below the surface. This has been fixed.

// V 1.1
-NEW FEATURE: eliminated the 90 degree rotation limitation when rotating the object placement guide using the X, Y and Z
			  shortuct keys. You can now choose the rotation increment that must be applied when one of these key is pressed. 
			  The rotation increment is configurable for each axis individually. Please see documentation chapters 2.2.3.1 
			  and 3.4.1.2.1;
-NEW FEATURE: added the possibility to drag and drop prefab folders into the category view. Please see documentation chapters
			  2.2.1.2 and 3.4.1.1;
-NEW FEATURE: added more random rotation settings for the 'Block' object placement method. You can now control randomization
		      settings for each axis individually. You can specify whether or not rotation can be randomized for a certain 
			  axis, whether or not negative rotation values can be generated and you can also control the randomization type
			  (Entire Range, Step). For 'Step', you can choose the random step value. Please see documentation chapter 3.4.1.2.3;
-NEW FEATURE: added possibility to reset the object placement guide's rotation to 0 on each axis individually. This can be done
			  by holding the SHIFT key down and then pressing the X, Y or Z button, depending on the axis which must have its
			  rotation reset. Please see documentation chapter 4.2;
-NEW FEATURE: added possibility to choose the pose rotation for tile connections. Please see documentation chapters 2.2.5.2.8.1
			  and 3.4.1.2.2.1;
-NEW FEATURE: the selected objects can now be moved, rotated and scaled using transform gizmos. You can also choose the transform
			  space in which these transformations occur. Please see documentation chapters 2.5.5, 3.4.3 and 4.2;
-NEW FEATURE: added ellipse selection tool. Please see documentation chapters 2.5.2 and 3.4.3;
-NEW FEATURE: you can now choose a fill color for the object selection primitives (rectangle or ellipse). Please see documentation
			  chapter 3.4.3;
-NEW FEATURE: there are now 2 selection modes available:  Standard - the one that has been available so far and Paint. In Paint
			  mode you can 'paint' your object selections. Please see documentation chapters 2.5.2 and 3.4.3;
-NEW FEATURE: holding down the CTRL/COMMAND key, you can now adjust the selection area size (rectangle or ellipse) proportionally
			  (width same as height) while dragging the mouse cursor. This feature applies only to the 'Standard' selection mode.
			  Please see documentation chapters 2.5.2 and 4.2;
-NEW FEATURE: added button which allows you to remove all prefabs from the active prefab category.

-FEATURE REMOVAL: removed the 'Save Current Snap Settings In Active Configuration' button in the 'Object Hierarchy Snapping Settings'
				  GUI section. Settings are now automatically saved in the active configuration when you make a change.

-BUG FIX: fixed bug which caused some tile connections to be positioned wrong for arbitrary grid orientations (e.g. X:45, Y:45, Z:0);
-BUG FIX: fixed object selection bug. When using a perspective camera, for some camera angles, the objects were not being selected even 
		  though they were clearly inside the object selection area;
-BUG FIX: fixed object selection bug. For some perspective camera angles, objects which were not visible on the screen and were sitting 
		  behind the camera, were still getting selected;
-BUG FIX: object selection boxes are now drawn as oriented boxes. Previously they were being rendred as AABBs and that was not the 
		  intended behaviour.
