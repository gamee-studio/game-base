1. PLUGIN SETUP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to start using the tool, create an empty game object, attach the 'Octave3D World Builder' 
script to it and you are good to go. For more info on how to use the tool, please check out the video 
tutorials (http://bit.ly/2aBS9TX). 

2. VERSION INFO
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please consult the 'Version History.txt' file to view the changes that were made for the current version.

3. PLEASE READ
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Some of the Editor Windows that you might have open can disappear after script recompile. I do not believe 
 this is Octave's fault. Seems more like a bug to me. Seems to be a known issue for some time: http://bit.ly/2qXau8U

-Starting with the latest version, you will need to press the 'Refresh scene' (below the main toolbar) button 
 when you attach objects manually as children of the Octave3D object. Otherwise, you will not be able to 
 interact with these objects.

Enjoy!
